In the quantum adversary method, we consider the query complexity of a quantum
algorithm with access to an oracle `O_x` that is in the control of some
adversarial party, in the sense that the adversary controls the value of `x`.
The adversary wishes to make the computation as difficult as possible and can
supply `x` in superposition.
