The degree of a polynomial representing (or approximating) a function f is a
lower bound for the number of quantum queries needed to compute f. This
observation has been a source of many lower bounds on quantum algorithms. It
has been an open problem whether this lower bound is tight.

We exhibit a function with polynomial degree M and quantum query complexity
`\Omega(M^{1.321...})`. This is the first superlinear separation between
polynomial degree and quantum query complexity. The lower bound is shown by a
new, more general version of quantum adversary method.
